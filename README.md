# User Scripts

Here is a list of scripts that users of mpv have published, adding functionality that is not part of the core mpv player.
Most of these scripts are **unofficial 3rd party scripts**. Anyone can add their own script by editing this wiki. On GitHub mpv scripts are tagged as [mpv-script](https://github.com/topics/mpv-script).

Scripts are usually placed in:
| OS | Location |
| --- | --- |
| GNU/Linux or macOS | `~/.config/mpv/scripts/` |
| Windows | `C:/Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/mpv/scripts/` |

    system based on mpv's Lua `mp.options` API). All modules are free to use
    (and extend) in your own scripts!

  **VideoPlayerCode Install-Notes**

    * The VideoPlayerCode scripts and modules use options at the dir
      ``~~/script-settings/`` (instead of the standard ``~~/script-opts/`` which
      is used by the builtin ``mp.options.read_options``).
  
    * The original installation instructions for the scripts are outdated. To
      install one of the VideoPlayerCode scripts, e.g. ``Blackbox.js``, do the
      following:
      * Inside your ``scripts`` dir create a dir ``Blackbox``, and into it copy
        the file ``Blackbox.js`` from the original distribution, as well as the
        directory ``modules.js`` (with all the files it contains).
      * Inside the ``Blackbox`` dir: rename the file ``Blackbox.js`` to
        ``main.js``, and rename the dir ``modules.js`` to ``modules``.
* **[mpv-easy](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy)**  
  TS and React toolkit for mpv script. https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpsm-scripts.

* **[mpsm](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/tree/main/mpv-mpsm)**  
  mpsm is a mpv script manager, you can install scripts provided by [mpsm-scripts](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpsm-scripts), or install any script with added [meta info](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpsm-scripts?tab=readme-ov-file#meta-info) via url.

  * reload - Sometimes you have unstable internet connection, or YouTube server dies, or your computer was sleeping for too long, or whatever. The thing is: you were watching something, you lost the connection, MPV doesn't want to play it further, you don't want to find the video again and then seek it to the moment you were watching.

## User Shaders

A guide for how to write user shaders [can be found here](https://libplacebo.org/custom-shaders/).

* **[A-Pack](https://github.com/butterw/bShaders/tree/master/A-pack)**  
  Shaders pack for quick Adjustment of (web) video: brightness/contrast curves (tooDark, tooBright, bShadows, bDim, etc.) and color (vibrance, skintones, Black&White). Runs on integrated graphics.

* **[Anime4K](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K)**  
  A series of shaders designed to scale and enhance anime. Includes shaders for line sharpening, artefact removal, denoising, upscaling, and more.

* **[LumaSharpenHook](https://gist.github.com/voltmtr/8b4404b4e23129b226b9e64863d3e28b)**  
  A sharpen filter similar to using Unsharp Mask in Photoshop ported from SweetFX shader pack.

* **[SSimDownscaler, SSimSuperRes, Krig, Adaptive Sharpen, etc.](https://gist.github.com/igv)**  
  * SSimDownscaler: Perceptually based downscaler.
  * SSimSuperRes: The aim of this shader is to make corrections to the image upscaled by mpv built-in scaler (removes ringing artifacts, restores original sharpness, etc).
  * Krig: Chroma scaler that uses luma information for high quality upscaling.

* **[Noise](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/noise.glsl)**  
  Simplistic filter that adds a tunable amount of uniform white noise to the output.

* **[Film Grain v1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/filmgrain.glsl)** and **[Film Grain v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/filmgrain-smooth.glsl)**  
  Two configurable shaders for applying gaussian-weighted white noise to the image. v2 is a smoothed version of v1, which uses an extra gaussian blur pass to shift the grain frequency spectrum. Both versions can trivially be adapted to add film grain to other channels besides `LUMA` by just adding it to the list of hooks.

* **[Antiringing](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/antiring.hook)**  
  This is an antiringing filter that works by clamping to the local neighbourhood. Sort of inspired by the mpv built-in antiringing algorithm, but it's extended in such a way that it also works well for polar (EWA) filters, which the mpv built-in algorithm does not support at all.

* **[nnedi3 and ravu](https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers/tree/master)**  
  User shaders for prescaling.

* **[FSRCNN](https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases)**

* **[FidelityFX CAS](https://gist.github.com/agyild/bbb4e58298b2f86aa24da3032a0d2ee6)**  
  AMD FidelityFX Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS) provides a mixed ability to sharpen and optionally scale an image. The algorithm adjusts the amount of sharpening per pixel to target an even level of sharpness across the image. Areas of the input image that are already sharp are sharpened less, while areas that lack detail are sharpened more. This allows for higher overall natural visual sharpness with fewer artifacts.


* **[FidelityFX FSR](https://gist.github.com/agyild/82219c545228d70c5604f865ce0b0ce5)**  
  AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution is a spatial upscaler: it works by taking the current anti-aliased frame and upscaling it to display resolution without relying on other data such as frame history or motion vectors. At the heart of FSR is a cutting-edge algorithm that detects and recreates high-resolution edges from the source image. Those high-resolution edges are a critical element required for turning the current frame into a “super resolution” image. FSR provides consistent upscaling quality regardless of whether the frame is in movement, which can provide quality advantages compared to other types of upscalers.

* **[NVIDIA Image Scaling](https://gist.github.com/agyild/7e8951915b2bf24526a9343d951db214)**  
  NVIDIA Image Scaling is a spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm. The scaling algorithm uses a 6-tap scaling filter combined with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters, which creates nice smooth images and sharp edges. In addition, an adaptive-directional sharpening-only algorithm is available. The directional scaling and sharpening algorithm is named NVScaler while the adaptive-directional-sharpening-only algorithm is named NVSharpen.

* **[Post upscale unsharp masking](https://github.com/garamond13/unsharp_masking.glsl)**  
  This is mpvs original image sharpening algorithm ported into the shader, in order to work only after upscaling is done.

  * hdeband is an implementation of a debanding algorithm that blurs homogeneous regions together

* **[Alt Scale](https://github.com/garamond13/alt-scale)**  
  An alternative to mpv's built in scaling. It can be slightly faster than built in scaling with equivalent quality.

* **[Unsharp mask and Gaussian blur](https://github.com/garamond13/Unsharp-mask-and-Gaussian-blur)**  
  A 2 pass unsharp mask and a 2 pass gaussian blur. Similar to those in Photoshop, Image Magick, Gimp, etc.

* **[2D Image Resampling](https://github.com/garamond13/2D-Image-Resampling)**  
  2D Image Resampling is a general resampling algorithm made for experimental / testing use.

* **[Ani4K v2 ArtCNN](https://github.com/Sirosky/Upscale-Hub/releases/tag/Ani4k-v2-ArtCNN)**  
  Ani4K v2 targets modern anime, from high quality Bluray to crappy WEB releases, for upscaling to either 2K or 4K.

* **[Snapdragon Game Super Resolution (GSR) v1](https://gist.github.com/agyild/7715b6b1f38427839d58f80884902cab)**  
  Snapdragon Game Super Resolution (GSR) v1 is a single-pass spatial upscaling technique originally developed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. It integrates upscaling and edge sharpening into one GPU shader pass, leveraging a 12-tap Lanczos-like scaling filter and an adaptive sharpening filter.

## VapourSynth Scripts

* **[mvtools](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/filters/mvtools.vpy)**  
  Use [MVTools](https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-mvtools)'s BlockFPS function to perform motion interpolation on the video in realtime.

* **[nnedi3](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/filters/nnedi3.vpy)**  
  Use [NNEDI3](https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3) to double the resolution of the video. This always performs a single doubling. Note that the vapoursynth-nnedi3 filter is so slow that this practically can't be used in realtime, so it's not much use in practice. 

* **[flash3kyuu](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/filters/flash3kyuu.vpy)**  
  Use [flash3kyuu](https://github.com/SAPikachu/flash3kyuu_deband) to deband the video, with reasonable (mildly grainy) default settings.
